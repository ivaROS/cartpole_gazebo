### ivaROS/cartpole_gazebo ###

A modified cartpole Gazebo simulation that requires control through "effort" as would be required
when creating one's own controller.  The aim is to hook in to the effort control signal via
python or Matlab for testing out different control algorithms.  This is why versions were added
as an alternative to the standard velocity controller interface. 
Eventually, several different control algorithms will be tested out.
